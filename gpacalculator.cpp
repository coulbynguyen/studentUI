/*What i want out of this program is that the enter a number of credits for a course and the grade they got. And then you convert that grade from
 * characters like A- to 3.75 yadda yadda. The easiest way this can be done is through maybe a switch case or else ifs but whatever
 * Also if you could try to make the function use pass by reference or pointers that'd be great If you need any help ill explain since you are
 * fairly new to this language -LUV TUM*/
